# -Decision-Tree-in-AI-Course


uses R programming to examine a dataset 
in order to determine whether diabetes will be 
present in a fresh input instance. Decision tree 
models will be trained and assessed using the 
dataset. The tasks involve calculating the primary 
statistics of each attribute (mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum, and maximum), examining the 
distribution of the target class, dividing the dataset 
into training and test data, training a decision tree 
model (M1), testing the model's accuracy on the test 
set, building a second model (M2) on a new split of 
50% training and 50% test data, comparing the 
accuracy of M2 with M1, and creating and plotting 
the decision trees of both models. Please be aware 
that in order to execute the analysis, the dataset 
must be available.
